# 🌍 Great Circle Navigation: AI-Supported Engineering Solutions 🚀

Welcome to the **Great Circle Navigation Challenge** – an exploration into the power of AI in engineering! Here, we solve the classic but complex problem of navigating around a sphere based on an initial point, bearing, and distance traveled as a fraction of the great circle.

## 🧭 About This Repository

Inside `TheChallenge.py`, you’ll find the Python function `great_circle_navigation_perfect()` which was developed entirely through prompting ChatGPT. This AI-generated solution doesn't just work; it dynamically handles variables such as:

- **Angular distances on a spherical model**
- **Latitude adjustments, even in edge cases** 🌐
- **Automatic updates for bearing and position**

Imagine automating calculations like these in **navigation**, **robotics**, or **geospatial analysis**. Engineers can now automate routine tasks, validating AI-optimized solutions while focusing their expertise on complex, creative challenges.

> **Key Takeaway**: While AI can create robust engineering solutions, human expertise ensures precision, reliability, and safety. With AI handling the heavy lifting, engineers are freer to innovate.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### The Function
The `great_circle_navigation_perfect()` function:
- Takes in starting latitude, longitude, initial bearing, and a travel fraction.
- Returns the final latitude, longitude, and bearing upon traveling the specified distance along the great circle.
- Handles extreme conditions by normalizing output values for accuracy.

### Unit Testing Included 🧪
Run `test_great_circle_navigation()` to see the function in action and verify its performance with preset test cases.
